# unit-testing2
This project aims to teach and facilitate the implementation of unit tests in Java applications using the JUnit and Mockito frameworks.
Code quality is one of the core pillars for a successful programmer, achieved through best practices, clean code maintenance, and â€” most importantly â€” the implementation of tests to ensure correct functionality.

JUnit is a framework that allows you to create and execute unit tests, verifying that each component works correctly under different scenarios. Mockito complements this by creating mock objects, which are essential when testing classes that interact with other dependencies, enabling more comprehensive and effective testing.

ðŸ“š What You Will Learn
Fundamentals of unit testing with JUnit.

How to use Mockito to mock dependencies for more complete tests.

When to use only JUnit and when to combine it with Mockito.

How to apply these techniques in Spring Java 8 projects.

How to improve code quality and robustness through effective testing.

ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience
Students or engineers who want to learn how to write unit tests for their code.

Developers seeking to improve the quality of their unit tests.

Programmers interested in strengthening their skills for industrial web development, a rapidly growing field.

ðŸ›  Importance of Testing
Implementing unit tests is essential to ensure that code behaves correctly and remains stable when changes or new features are introduced.
Unit testing helps detect bugs early, makes software maintenance easier, and increases confidence in the final product.

ðŸ’¡ This project serves as a practical guide for developers who want to level up their software testing skills in the Java and Spring ecosystem, bringing significant value to professional growth and software quality.
